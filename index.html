    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <h5>The Sorcerer’s Void project aims to be a reimagined Souls-like video game created in Unreal Engine 5, combining the elements of action, strategy and cinematic gameplay to give a fresh take on the genre. Set in a mysterious medieval world, the player's goal is to escape and return home by navigating a dangerous landscape filled with unique enemies and combat challenges. This project will implement features such as a refined combat system with fluid mechanics for attacking, dodging, parrying, and cinematic executions that encourage a strategic approach to the gameplay. This document outlines the revised concept and project management plan for Sorcerer’s Void, detailing the design vision, implementation goals, and development framework to ensure a successful product that showcases an innovative gaming experience.</h5>
